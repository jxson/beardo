<p class="vanilla template">
  Vanilla is a flavor derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily
  from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia). The word
  vanilla, derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself
  meaning sheath or pod), simply translates as little pod.[1] Pre-Columbian
  Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called
  tlilxochitl by the Aztecs, and Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is
  credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.
